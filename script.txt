A cord snakes in under the door.\r\n\r\n\tMASTER BATHROOM\r\n\r\n\tJean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess\r\n\tphone.\r\n\r\n\tThe phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile\r\n\tfloor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its\r\n\tcord ripped free.\r\n\r\n\tWith a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.\r\n\r\n\tBEDROOM\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door\r\n\tand frame, and is working it.\r\n\r\n\tBATHROOM\r\n\r\n\tJean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it\r\n\topen.

Grimsrud follows.\r\n\r\n\tBEDROOM\r\n\r\n\tJean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain\r\n\tbut awkwardly trying to push it off.\r\n\r\n\tUPSTAIRS LANDING\r\n\r\n\tStill thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,\r\n\ttrips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the\r\n\tstairs.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud trots down after her.\r\n\r\n\tA PLAQUE:  WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED\r\n\r\n\tINT.

He gives\r\n\ta finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over.\r\n\r\n\tOUTSIDE\r\n\r\n\tGary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel\r\n\tin the snow.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAN\r\n\t\tHow ya doin\'?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tGARY\r\n\t\tMr. Mohra?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAN\r\n\t\tYah.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tGARY\r\n\t\tOfficer Olson.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAN\r\n\t\tYah, right-o.\r\n\r\n\tThe two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and\r\n\twithout standing particularly close.  They stand stiffly,\r\n\tarms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their\r\n\tparka hoods.  Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head\r\n\tdrawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face\r\n\tfrom protruding into the cold.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAN\r\n\t\t...  So, I\'m tendin\' bar there at\r\n\t\tEcklund && Swedlin\'s last Tuesday\r\n\t\tand this little guy\'s drinkin\'\r\n\t\tand he says, \'So where can a guy\r\n\t\tfind some action - I\'m goin\' crazy\r\n\t\tdown there at the lake.\'  And I\r\n\t\tsays, \'What kinda action?\' and he\r\n\t\tsays, \'Woman action, what do I\r\n\t\tlook like,\'  And I says \'Well,\r\n\t\twhat do I look like, I don\'t\r\n\t\tarrange that kinda thing,\' and he\r\n\t\tsays, \'I\'m goin\' crazy out there\r\n\t\tat the lake\' and I says, \'Well,\r\n\t\tthis ain\'t that kinda place.\'\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tGARY\r\n\t\tUh-huh.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAN\r\n\t\tSo he says, \'So I get it, so you\r\n\t\tthink I\'m some kinda jerk for\r\n\t\taskin\',\' only he doesn\'t use the\r\n\t\tword jerk.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tGARY\r\n\t\tI unnerstand.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMAN\r\n\t\tAnd then he calls me a jerk and\r\n\t\tsays the last guy who thought he\r\n\t\twas a jerk was dead now.

He is staring down at something in the\r\n\tfront seat next to him.\r\n\r\n\tHis other hand holds open the briefcase.  It has money\r\n\tinside - a lot of money.\r\n\r\n\tCarl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and\r\n\tlooks at it.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCARL\r\n\t\t...  Mmmnphh.\r\n\r\n\tHe paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling\r\n\tfor the amount.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCARL\r\n\t\t...  Jeshush Shrist...  Jeshush\r\n\t\tfuchem Shrist!\r\n\r\n\tExcited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto\r\n\tthe back seat.\r\n\r\n\tHe starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer\r\n\tpressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to\r\n\this skin by clotted blood.\r\n\r\n\tHe pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow\r\n\tagain.\r\n\r\n\tHe carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it\r\n\tremains adhering to his jaw.\r\n\r\n\tEXT. CAR\r\n\r\n\tIt is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road.  THe\r\n\tdoor opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.\r\n\r\n\tHe slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the\r\n\tembankment to a barbed-wire fence.  He kneels at one of the\r\n\tfence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare\r\n\thands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.\r\n\r\n\tHe stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his\r\n\tred, frozen hands.\r\n\r\n\tHe looks to the right.\r\n\r\n\tA regular line of identical fence posts stretches away\r\n\tagainst unblemished white.\r\n\r\n\tHe looks to the left.\r\n\r\n\tA regular line of identical fence posts stretches away\r\n\tagainst unblemished white.\r\n\r\n\tHe looks at the fence post in front of him.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tCARL\r\n\t\tMmmphh...\r\n\r\n\tHe looks about the snowy vastness for a marker.  Finding\r\n\tnone, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to\r\n\tscar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up\r\n\tagainst the post.\r\n\r\n\tHe bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it\r\n\tagainst his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.\r\n\r\n\tHOTEL ROOM\r\n\r\n\tMarge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.\r\n\tShe is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on\r\n\tthe phone.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\tNo, I\'m leavin\' this mornin\', back\r\n\t\tup to Brainerd.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\r\n\t\tWell, I\'m sorry I won\'t see ya.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\tMm.

Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper\r\n\tand beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically\r\n\tchecks.  The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible\r\n\tentries.\r\n\r\n\tJerry hums nervously.\r\n\r\n\tGlass rattles as someone taps at his door.\r\n\r\n\tJerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit\r\n\twith worry.\r\n\r\n\tMarge sticks her head in the door.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\tMr. Lundegaard?

Then, with one curved arm half pressing\r\n\tagainst, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly\r\n\tsteps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the\r\n\ttrees angling toward the cabin and the source of the\r\n\tgrinding noise.\r\n\r\n\tShe slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her\r\n\tdownhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the\r\n\tnext.\r\n\r\n\tThe roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree,\r\n\ther breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints\r\n\tdown toward the cabin\'s back lot.\r\n\r\n\tA tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted\r\n\tjacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a\r\n\tlarge power tool which his body blocks from view.\r\n\r\n\tMarge advances.\r\n\r\n\tThe man is forcing downward something which engages the\r\n\troaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.\r\n\r\n\tThe man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the\r\n\tcold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams\r\n\tas he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a\r\n\tshod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.\r\n\r\n\tThe roar is very loud.\r\n\r\n\tMarge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we\r\n\tcan now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.\r\n\r\n\tMarge\'s eyes shift.\r\n\r\n\tA large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends\r\n\tdown out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.\r\n\tHe uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.\r\n\r\n\tMarge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward\r\n\tGrimsrud, who is still turned away.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.\r\n\r\n\tMarge closes in, grimacing.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud\'s back strains as he puts his weight into the log\r\n\tthat pushes down into the machine.\r\n\r\n\tThe dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of\r\n\tCarl Showalter\'s body.\r\n\r\n\tMarge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it\r\n\tsounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the\r\n\troar of the power tool.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\tStop!  Police!  Turn around and\r\n\t\thands up!\r\n\r\n\tStartled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.\r\n\r\n\tHe stares.\r\n\r\n\tMarge bellows again:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  Hands up!\r\n\r\n\tConscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her\r\n\tshoulder the armpatch insignia.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  Police!\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud stares.\r\n\r\n\tWith a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at\r\n\tMarge and then starts running away.\r\n\r\n\tMarge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.\r\n\r\n\tNo need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands\r\n\tin the snow several feet short of her.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep\r\n\tsnow.\r\n\r\n\tBehind him:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  Halt!\r\n\r\n\tShe fires in the air.\r\n\r\n\tShe lowers the gun and carefully sighs.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  Halt!\r\n\r\n\tShe fires.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.\r\n\r\n\tMarge sights again.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  Halt!\r\n\r\n\tShe fires again.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud pitches forward.  He mutters in Swedish as he\r\n\treaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.\r\n\r\n\tMarge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand\r\n\treaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.\r\n\r\n\tIt comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with\r\n\ta snap of the wrist.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  All right, buddy.  On your\r\n\t\tbelly and your hands clasped\r\n\t\tbehind you.\r\n\r\n\tTHE CRUISER\r\n\r\n\tMarge drives.  Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed\r\n\tbehind him.\r\n\r\n\tFor a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and\r\n\tthe periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge\r\n\tgrimly shakes her head.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard\r\n\t\tin there?\r\n\r\n\tShe glances up in the rear-view mirror.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the\r\n\troad.\r\n\r\n\tMarge shakes her head.\r\n\r\n\tAt length:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  I guess that was your\r\n\t\taccomplice in the wood chipper.\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud\'s head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is\r\n\tmotionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  And those three people in\r\n\t\tBrainerd.\r\n\r\n\tNo response.\r\n\r\n\tMarge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  And for what?  For a little\r\n\t\tbit of money.\r\n\r\n\tWe hear distant sirens.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  There\'s more to life than money,\r\n\t\tyou know.\r\n\r\n\tShe glances up in the rear-view mirror.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  Don\'t you know that?...  And\r\n\t\there ya are, and it\'s a beautiful\r\n\t\tday...\r\n\r\n\tGrimsrud\'s hollow eyes stare out.\r\n\r\n\tThe sirens are getting louder.  Marge pulls over.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  Well...\r\n\r\n\tShe leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling\r\n\tWHOOPS on her siren.\r\n\r\n\tShe turns on her flashers.\r\n\r\n\tShe leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.\r\n\r\n\tShe stares forward, shakes her head.  We hear the dull click\r\n\tof her flashers.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\r\n\t\t...  I just don\'t unnerstand it.\r\n\r\n\tOutside it is snowing.
